Terms/Definitions:

The Welcome Page will contain two options for the user to either click:
1. Add new terms to the database
2. View already existing terms

Add New Terms - HTML Page that will require user input for brand new terms that need to be stored

View Existing Terms - Endpoint for GET /terms for existing terms that are stored in the database


Will need to implement a button that completes adding the terms
